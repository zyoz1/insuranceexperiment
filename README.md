Appendix A 


Instructions for Slovic et al. replication In this survey, I am going to describe a series of gambling games. Each game has the possibility of negative outcomes. Each allows you to buy insurance against the negative outcomes, although it is not required. I am not going to ask you to play any of the games. Instead, I am going to ask you to consider each and then tell me how you would play were they for real. Try to take each as seriously as possible, even though nothing is at stake. Each game consists of drawing one ball from each set of baskets. Each contains a different mixture of orange and white balls. If I were to draw a white ball, no loss would occur. If I were to draw an orange ball, this would result a loss, unless you had purchased insurance. (Remember, we will not actually play any of these gambles, but I want you to think about each as if you were really going to play each one.) As you can see, you can only lose in this sort of game (either by drawing an orange ball or by buying insurance). Your object is to lose as little as possible. For each game figure out what insurance you would buy to end up with the fewest negative points.
